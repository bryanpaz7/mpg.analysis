# **MPG Analysis Using Python**

## **Project Description**
This project analyzes fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - MPG) across different vehicle types and countries. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I explored how various factors, such as vehicle type and region, impact fuel consumption. The goal was to identify the most fuel-efficient vehicles and compare trends across three different countries.

## **Tools & Libraries Used**
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## **Key Features & Analysis**
✔ Cleaned and structured raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy
✔ Performed MPG analysis to compare vehicle fuel efficiency across three different countries
✔ Analyzed and visualized fuel consumption trends by vehicle type to identify the most efficient cars
✔ Generated insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key findings

## **Key Findings**
- Vehicles from **Japan** had the highest average MPG, indicating superior fuel efficiency
- **Low cylinder vehicles** exhibited significantly lower MPG compared to higher cylinder cars
- Hybrid and electric vehicles outperformed traditional gasoline cars in fuel efficiency

## **Future Improvements**
- Integrate real-world fuel price data for cost efficiency analysis
- Explore the impact of additional vehicle attributes like horsepower and weight
- Implement machine learning models to predict MPG based on vehicle specs
